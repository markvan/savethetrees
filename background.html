        In 2020, the Egypt Exploration Society (EES) submitted a planning application to remove
        two massive (six+ story high) London plane trees from the garden
        of 8 Doughty Street. The reason given for this was that one of the trees was
        causing damage to an EEs building's back wall, but that was not proven beyond observing
        internal plasterwork cracking.</p>
    <p>At that time the EES had not carried out the checks
        required by their own structural engineers to help work out if there was tree-related
        damage to the walls. This was to involve checking the walls for movement over a period of one year
        using devices called tell-tails. As of 2022, the EES have still not done this.
    </p>
    <p>Camden Council wisely rejected the 2020 planning application and placed Tree Preservation
        Orders on the plane trees after receiving extensive objections from Councillors and local residents on ecological
    and quality-of-life grounds.</p>
    <p>Importantly, in 2020 local architects and three different structural engineers identified that the
    trees could not be removed without damaging the closest EES building and neighbouring buildings. They
    proposed that with a small modification to the wall next to the trees so that the trees and the EES building
    could happily and successfully co-exist for the foreseeable future.</p>
    <p>Now in 2022, the EES is still trying to get the trees cut down via a new planning application.
        In this, the EES have not considered
    the alternative plan  to modify the wall and keep the trees. </p>
    <p> Instead, with their new planning application they have submitted an inconclusive soil analysis, an arboriculturalist's
         report that says nothing of significance, and a new
    structural engineers report.</p>
    <p>The EES have still not done all the investigatory work specified by their engineers in 2020,
    nor have they done all the investigatory work specified in their current 2022 engineers report.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, and very importantly,
    the EES's stuctural engineers state in their current 2022 report that removing the trees provides a medium risk of
    damaging both the EES building and, by extension, its neighbouring buildings.</p>
    <p>What is definitely not needed is a two yearly cycle of planning applications and community responses to those
        applications.</p>
    <p>Rather a solution  is needed that is a win-win for the EES and for the local community,
        Camden and London at large. A solution that enables the EES to be happy about their building,
    and the community to be happy about the continuing and considerable ecological and amenity values of the trees
    for the foreseeable future.</p>
    <p>Local residents are now are working with engineers and architects
    to develop such a solution based on the 2020 ideas. Together they believe that this involves making
    minor modifications to the wall next to the trees, setting the ground-floor wall
    back by about 0.5m. </p>
    <p>The EES's director has privately stated to a local resident that the EES wants to establish a public archeology centre in their buildings.
        With the proposed
         modification to the wall nearest the trees there is a possibility to open out new windows onto the
        trees and enhance visitors' experiences on visiting the centre;
        with visitors being able to marvel at the trees. </p>
    <p> The cost of this is currently thought be less than the cost of removing the trees and performing post-removal works
        on the wall to correct the effects of removing the trees. </p>
    <p>In this, the EES are far from being an
        impoverished charity. According to their audited accounts on the UK Government's
        Charities website, as of 31 March 2021, the EES had an unallocated fund of £236,409
        that is available for general use, plus investments of £347,980. A move to modern practices of publishing
        subscription volumes online would free up considerably more funds.
        The proposed works to the wall to help retain the trees would be a mere fraction
        of the total value £584,389 of the two sums above,
        and, indeed, only a very small component of the cost to turn the EES buildings into
        a public archeology centre (which no doubt would be campaign and grant funded).</p>
    <p> The EES could not have been unaware of the size and proximity of trees when they purchased their
        property in 1993. With the Climate Crisis, we can not afford to have less trees, and indeed we
        should have more. And as an organisation interested in preservation in general,
        it would be in line with EES objectives to preserve the trees, and in fact benefit
        from having them visible to staff in and visitors to their premises.
    </p>
    <p> There is considerable architectural, property development and building project management
        expertise in the neighbourhood and
        local architects and other neighbours would love to engage
        with the EES to help them realise their target of a
        public archeology centre while retaining the trees. </p>
    <p>Together the EES and its neighbours  could make considerable strides forward in realising
        this target, not only neighbours by offering pro-bono architectural and building-related services,
        but also in activities like publicity, social media campaigns and fund-raising.
        </p>
    <p>It would be crazy to remove the trees,
        losing their manifold advantages and risking destabilising several buildings,
        when there is a creative engineering and architectural solution that
        offers a win-win solution for all concerned.</p>
